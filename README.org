  PTrader provides a Stock Trader framework. It allows to get real time stock
  info from finances.yahoo.com and pretty-print the results on a terminal.

  With the usual commands to install as a user library, from the source folder:

  install the depends in global and then the ptrader as user:

  : sudo cabal install split==0.1.* curl==1.3.* ansi-terminal==0.5.* --global
  : cabal install --user
   
  Running the example:
   
  : ghci examples/example01.hs
  : *Main> main
